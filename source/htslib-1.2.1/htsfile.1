.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBhtsfile\fR utility attempts to identify what kind of high-throughput
sequencing data files the specified files are, and provides minimal viewing
capabilities for some kinds of data file.
.P
It can identify sequencing data files such as SAM, BAM, and CRAM;
variant calling data files such as VCF and BCF;
index files used to index these data files;
and compressed versions of many of them.
.P
For each \fIFILE\fR given, \fBhtsfile\fP prints a description of the file
format determined, using similar keyword conventions to \fBfile\fP(1):
"text" indicates a textual file that can probably be viewed on a terminal;
"data" indicates binary data;
"sequence", "variant calling", and "index" indicate different categories of
data file.
When it can be identified, the name of the particular file format (such as
"BAM" or "VCF") is printed at the start of the description.
.P
When used to view file contents as text, \fBhtsfile\fP can optionally show
only headers or only data records, but has no other filtering capabilities.
Use \fBsamtools\fR or \fBbcftools\fR if you need more extensive viewing or
filtering capabilities.
.P
The following options are accepted:
.TP 4n
.BR -c ", " --view
Instead of identifying the specified files, display a textual representation
of their contents on standard output.
.TP
.BR -h ", " --header-only
Display data file headers only.
Implies \fB--view\fR.
.TP
.BR -H ", " --no-header
When viewing files, display data records only.
