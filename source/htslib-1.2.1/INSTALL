Basic Installation
==================

To build and install HTSlib, 'cd' to the htslib-1.x directory containing
the package's source and type the following commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The './configure' command checks your build environment and allows various
optional functionality to be enabled (see Configuration below).  If you
don't want to select any optional functionality, you may wish to omit
configure and just type 'make; make install' as for previous versions
of HTSlib.  However if the build fails you should run './configure' as
it can diagnose the common reasons for build failures.

The 'make' command builds the HTSlib library and and various useful
utilities: bgzip, htsfile, and tabix.  If compilation fails you should
run './configure' as it can diagnose problems with your build environment
that cause build failures.

The 'make install' command installs the libraries, library header files,
utilities, several manual pages, and a pkgconfig file to /usr/local.
The installation location can be changed by configuring with --prefix=DIR
or via 'make prefix=DIR install' (see Installation Locations below).


Configuration
=============

By default, './configure' examines your build environment, checking for
requirements such as the zlib development files, and arranges for a plain
HTSlib build.  The following configure options can be used to enable
various features and specify further optional external requirements:

--with-irods[=DIR]
    Specifies the location of the iRODS client library to use to enable
    access to data objects stored in iRODS (<http://irods.org/>) via file
    paths like 'irods:DATAOBJ'.  DIR is the base of an iRODS source tree
    such that the library is present as DIR/lib/core/obj/libRodsAPI.* and
    headers are present under DIR/lib/api/include and so on.  If '=DIR' is
    omitted, $IRODS_HOME will be used as a base directory.

The configure script also accepts the usual options and environment variables
for tuning installation locations and compilers: type './configure --help'
for details.  For example,

    ./configure CC=icc --prefix=/opt/icc-compiled

would specify that HTSlib is to be built with icc and installed into bin,
lib, etc subdirectories under /opt/icc-compiled.


Installation Locations
======================

By default, 'make install' installs HTSlib libraries under /usr/local/lib,
HTSlib header files under /usr/local/include, utility programs under
/usr/local/bin, etc.  (To be precise, the header files are installed within
a fixed 'htslib' subdirectory under the specified .../include location.)

You can specify a different location to install HTSlib by configuring
with --prefix=DIR or specify locations for particular parts of HTSlib by
configuring with --libdir=DIR and so on.  Type './configure --help' for
the full list of such install directory options.

Alternatively you can specify different locations at install time by
typing 'make prefix=DIR install' or 'make libdir=DIR install' and so on.
Consult the list of prefix/exec_prefix/etc variables near the top of the
Makefile for the full list of such variables that can be overridden.

You can also specify a staging area by typing 'make DESTDIR=DIR install',
possibly in conjunction with other --prefix or prefix=DIR settings.
For example,

    make DESTDIR=/tmp/staging prefix=/opt

would install into bin, lib, etc subdirectories under /tmp/staging/opt.
