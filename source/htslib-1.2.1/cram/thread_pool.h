/*
 * This file implements a thread pool for multi-threading applications.
 * It consists of two distinct interfaces: thread pools an results queues.
 *
 * The pool of threads is given a function pointer and void* data to pass in.
 * This means the pool can run jobs of multiple types, albeit first come
 * first served with no job scheduling.
 *
 * Upon completion, the return value from the function pointer is added to
 * a results queue. We may have multiple queues in use for the one pool.
 *
 * An example: reading from BAM and writing to CRAM with 10 threads. We'll
 * have a pool of 10 threads and two results queues holding decoded BAM blocks
 * and encoded CRAM blocks respectively.
