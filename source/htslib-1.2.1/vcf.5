.SH DESCRIPTION
The Variant Call Format (VCF) is a TAB-delimited format with each data line
consisting of the following fields:
.TS
nlbl.
1	CHROM	CHROMosome name
2	POS	the left-most POSition of the variant
3	ID	unique variant IDentifier
4	REF	the REFerence allele
5	ALT	the ALTernate allele(s) (comma-separated)
6	QUAL	variant/reference QUALity
7	FILTER	FILTERs applied
8	INFO	INFOrmation related to the variant (semicolon-separated)
9	FORMAT	FORMAT of the genotype fields (optional; colon-separated)
10+	SAMPLE	SAMPLE genotypes and per-sample information (optional)
.TE

The following table gives the \fBINFO\fP tags used by samtools and bcftools.
.TP
.B AF1
